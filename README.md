### Hey 👋

Hi, I’m Carl-Erik!  I’m a software engineer who _enjoys_ (*) doing **open source** development and **building products**. I am a pretty decent programmer that can contribute to most projects no matter the tech stack (I am relatively tech agnostic), but I fully acknowledge there are smarter and more capable programmers out there. I just happen to be quite good at debugging and fixing other people's mess.
