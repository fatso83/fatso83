### Hey üëã

Hi, I‚Äôm Carl-Erik!  I‚Äôm a Norwegian software engineer who enjoys doing **open source** development and **building products**. I help maintain the Sinon project and have for the last few years spent my days in [a startup aimed at the hospital sector](https://diffia.com). I am a pretty decent programmer that can contribute to most projects no matter the tech stack (I am relatively tech agnostic), but I fully acknowledge there are smarter, more productive and more capable programmers out there. I just happen to be quite good at debugging almost anything and fixing other people's mistakes (including my own, which are plentiful =p).

My strong suit is tool building and a constant curiousness and thirst for how things (do not) work. I have had a tendency to invest quite a bit of energy and time into making POCs of things I _think should exist_. Often exotic stuff that no one has actually asked for (like mocking frameworks for unit testing VimScript :neckbeard:). I work with whatever technology is needed, knowing that most differences are of a superficial nature.

My weak spot is a tendency to [blurt out critique](https://dev.to/kopseng/comment/1blbi) before thinking long enough on how to make it palatable or if it should be said at all. I am working on it.
